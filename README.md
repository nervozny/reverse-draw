# Reverse Draw

A simple backend for a drawing application where mouse movements are mirrored (e.g., left to right, up to bottom). Inspired by my experience transitioning from Windows to Mac.

## Features
- **Mirror mouse movements in real time**: A unique and fun drawing experience.
- **Standalone executable**: No need for additional installations.
- **Lightweight and easy to use**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Windows OS**: Required to run the `.exe` file.

### Installation
1. **Download the latest release**:
   - Visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/nervozny/reverse-draw/releases) and download the `.exe` file.

2. **Run the application**:
   - Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file to launch the app.
   - If a security warning appears, click **More Info > Run Anyway**.

### Notes
- **No additional dependencies**: The application is fully self-contained.
- **Troubleshooting**:
